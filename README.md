# PKGBUILDs

### Description
This is the repository for the **Aurochs Linux** project currently featuring:

1. Aurman - Aur Helper for Arch Linux
2. Discord - A real-time voice/text chat application for gamers.
    * Libc++ - C++ Library is a dependency for Discord

### Using the Repo on non-Aurochs systems
First you will need to import my key which you can do easily `pacman --recv-key 6709A868`
Then add to your `pacman.conf`
```[aurochs]

Server = https://github.com/AurochsLinux/PKGBUILDs/releases/download/Release/```

### Contributing New Packages

Contributing a new package is as simple as forking the repo making the PKGBUILD file under the SRC and requesting a merge. I'll usually take over maintaining the packages from there

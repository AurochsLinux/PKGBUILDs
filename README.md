# PKGBUILDs

### Description
This is the repository for the **Aurochs Linux** project currently featuring:

1. Aurman - Aur Helper for Arch Linux
2. Libc++ - C++ Library is a dependency for one of our other packages
3. Discord - A real-time voice/text chat application for gamers.


### Contributing New Packages

Contributing a new package is as simple as forking the repo making the PKGBUILD file under the SRC and requesting a merge. I'll usually take over maintaining the packages from there
